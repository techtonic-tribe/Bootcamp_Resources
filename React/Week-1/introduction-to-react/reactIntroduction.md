## 📘 What is React?

**React** is a free and open-source **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces** or **UI components**. It was developed by **Facebook (now Meta)** and is widely used in modern web development to create **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

React allows developers to build **interactive UIs** efficiently using **declarative code**, meaning you describe what you want to see and React handles the rendering and updates when your data changes.

React encourages building interfaces using **reusable components**, making code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.



## 🚀 Why Use React?

React has become one of the most popular tools for frontend development, and here’s why:

- ✅ **Component-Based Architecture**: Break down UIs into small, reusable pieces.
- ✅ **Declarative Syntax**: Makes code more readable and predictable.
- ✅ **Fast Rendering**: Uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.
- ✅ **Strong Community**: Tons of support, libraries, and learning resources.
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works with React Native for mobile development.


React helps in building **dynamic and performant user experiences** quickly and effectively.

## 📘 What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript used in **React**. It allows developers to **write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript**, making the code easier to read and understand when working with UI elements.

JSX is not valid JavaScript by itself—it is transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like **Babel** before being rendered by the browser.

## 🛠️ Why Use JSX?

JSX improves development by:

- ✅ Writing UI in a declarative and familiar syntax.
- ✅ Combining markup and logic in a single file.
- ✅ Enabling dynamic rendering using JavaScript expressions.

## 🔍 JSX vs HTML

While JSX looks similar to HTML, there are a few important differences:

| HTML | JSX |
|------|-----|
| `class` | `className` |
| `for` | `htmlfor` |

2. You must return a single element
JSX needs to return one root element. You can’t return multiple elements side-by-side without wrapping them.

❌ This throws an error:
```
return (
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
);
```
✅ You need a wrapper:
```

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </div>
);
```
Or use React Fragments:
```

return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </>
);
```
3. JavaScript in JSX needs curly braces {}
You can use JS expressions, but only inside {}:

```
const num = 3;
return <p>The number is {num}</p>;
```
