### 💥 What `preventDefault()` Actually Does:

`event.preventDefault()` is used in JavaScript to **stop the browser’s default behavior** when an event is triggered.

#### 💡 Example:
In a `<form>` element, the default behavior on submit is to **reload the page**. That’s annoying and messes with SPA (Single Page App) vibes.

So we do:
```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault(); // stops the reload
  // now we can handle the data with JavaScript
});
```

### 🎯 When You’d Use It:
- **Forms** – to stop page reloads
- **Anchor tags `<a>`** – to stop navigation (like for tabs, modals, etc.)
- **Drag-and-drop events** – to override browser handling
- **Touch / click events** – to prevent scrolling or zooming

---

### 🤯 What Happens If You *Don’t* Use It?

If you don’t use `preventDefault()` in a form submission, your page will reload and:
- All JS data in memory = lost
- Your form might get submitted to a server even if you're not ready
- User experience = busted

### 🧠 Let’s Analyze the Assumptions

#### ❗Assumption: You always need it
> Not true. Only use it when you’re deliberately **handling something custom**.

#### ❗Assumption: It cancels everything
> Nope. It cancels the *default behavior*, not the **event itself**. If you also want to stop the event from bubbling up to parent elements, you’d use:
```js
e.stopPropagation();
```

### 🔁 TL;DR
`preventDefault()` = "Yo browser, chill. I got this."

It puts **you** in control instead of letting the browser do its old-school thing.
